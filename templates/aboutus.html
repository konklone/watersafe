					<h3> What information does H2Osafe provide ? </h3>
					<p>
						In the US, 85% of population is served water through a public water system (PWS).
						EPA regulates each PWS by <u>checking for over 90 different contaminants </u>like nitrate, arsenic etc and any violation in the contaminant level is reported to the public.
						<br>
						H2Osafe has compiled this contamination incident information for each PWS in every county and have ranked counties in their state. Ranking is based on any violation that has happened since 2012
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>What does PWS have to do with water in my tap?</h3>
					<p>
						A Public Water System (PWS) is one that serves piped water to at least 25 persons or 15 service connections for at least 60 days each year.
						The source of water for a PWS is either
					</p>
					<ol class="text-danger">
						<li>
							Groundwater : 131,672 PWS uses groundwater to serve 98.2 million Americans
						</li>
						<li>
							Surface water (rivers, reservoirs etc) : 13,504 PWS uses surface water to serve 213.3 million Americans
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<h3> Where did all this data come from ? </h3>
					<p>
						EPA has opened up all PWS and its violation related <a href="http://www.epa.gov/enviro/facts/sdwis/model.html">data</a> as webservices. 
						All this data was downloaded and offline analysis was done to find the total violations in each county. 
						Each county is then ranked and grouped into a Green or Orange or Red zone depending on violations since 2012.
						All historical contamination violation can also been seen in the results
					</p>
					<p>
						 Health effects due to most of the contaminants are provided by EPA <a href="http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/">here.</a>
						 Assistance was provided by EPA to identify health effects for remainder of the contaminants.
